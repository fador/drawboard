# Drawboard
*by Fador*

Multi-user drawing board written in Flash AS3 with C++ server software. Started ages ago and now it's time to upgrade ;)
Has been in use with older server software (not included, you don't want to see it.. ;) ).
Draw area has been quite small and I was suppose to add support for larger area.

Has been made only for Finnish users so sorry for everything being in finnish..I'm going to fix that soon =)
